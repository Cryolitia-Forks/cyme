# Cyme

A macOS `system_profiler SPUSBDataType` parser and utility that attempts to maintain compatibility with but also build upon `lsusb`. The project started as a quick replacement for the barely working [lsusb script](https://github.com/jlhonora/lsusb) and is my _yearly_ Rust project to keep up to date!

I'd like to build this into a modern `lsusb` tool, akin to `lsd`, `fd` etc. It is currently in flux as I build the foundations, learn about custom serde Deserializers and newer Rust features.

The name comes from the technical term for the type of blossom on a Apple tree: [cyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence#Determinate_or_cymose) - it is Apple related and also looks like a USB device tree ðŸ˜ƒðŸŒ¸.

# Features

* Compatible with `lsusb` using `--lsusb` argument. Supports all arguments including `--verbose` output using [libusb](https://github.com/dcuddeback/libusb-rs).
* Filters like `lsusb` but that also work when printing `--tree`. Adds `--filter_name`, `filter_serial` and option to hide empty `--hide-buses`/`--hide-hubs`.
* Modern terminal features with coloured output, utf-8 characters and icons.
* Works as a library too with `system_profiler` parsing crate and `lsusb` crate for libusb.

## Planned Features

* Controllable block data like `lsd --blocks`
* Vendor ID nerd font icon look up and icon theming like `lsd --icon`.
* Modern drawing of device tree with utf-8 boxes.
* Tree support of all device interfaces and endpoints.
* libusb optional to get more USB data and support other OS with switch from `system_profiler`.
* Interface and Device Descriptor icon look up.

# Install

From crates.io with a Rust tool-chain installed: `cargo install cyme`. If wishing to do it from within a local clone: `cargo install --path .`.

If wishing to use full `lsusb` support, include the 'libusb' feature with `cargo install --features libusb cyme`

I also have a Homebrew tap: `brew tap tuna-f1sh/cyme`.

## Alias `lsusb`

If you want to create a macOS version of lsusb, create an alias in your environment with the `--lsusb` compatibility flag:

`alias lsusb='cyme --lsusb'`

The `--verbose` argument requires the 'libusb' feature - see Install.

# Usage

Will cover this more as it develops. Use `cyme --help` for basic usage.
